The game logic must be fully contained in a single HTML string with inline JS and CSS. The backend should detect game-creation intents broadly (e.g., 'make me a platformer', 'create a shooter', 'build a puzzle game', 'make a racing game', etc.) and respond with both a text message and a populated gamePayload field.",
