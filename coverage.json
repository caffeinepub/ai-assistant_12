When detected, the AI must return a structured response containing a self-contained playable mini-game (e.g., Snake, Pong, Memory Match, Breakout, or similar simple arcade game) encoded as an HTML/JS payload or a structured game definition that the frontend can render. The response must include a special marker or metadata field (e.g., a gamePayload field alongside the text message) so the frontend can distinguish game responses from regular chat.",

The game should appear in an embedded sandbox (e.g., an iframe with srcdoc or a canvas-based renderer) within the AI message bubble. Include a visible 'Play Game' label or title above the game area, and allow the user to interact with the game without leaving the chat.",
