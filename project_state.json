When detected, the AI must return a structured response containing a self-contained playable mini-game (e.g., Snake, Pong, Memory Match, Breakout, or similar simple arcade game) encoded as an HTML/JS payload or a structured game definition that the frontend can render. The response must include a special marker or metadata field (e.g., a gamePayload field alongside the text message) so the frontend can distinguish game responses from regular chat.",
