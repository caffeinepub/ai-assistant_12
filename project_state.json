      "summary": "Extend the backend AI response logic in main.mo so that when a user asks the AI to create, build, or make a video game (of any genre or description), the AI generates a structured gamePayload containing a complete, self-contained HTML/CSS/JavaScript game that can be rendered in a sandboxed iframe. The game logic must be fully contained in a single HTML string with inline JS and CSS. The backend should detect game-creation intents broadly (e.g., 'make me a platformer', 'create a shooter', 'build a puzzle game', 'make a racing game', etc.) and respond with both a text message and a populated gamePayload field.",
