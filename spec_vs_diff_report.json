  "summary": "The diff implements changes across backend/main.mo, frontend GameRenderer, and ChatInterface. REQ-2 and REQ-3 appear well-implemented. However, REQ-1 has a critical gap: the backend main.mo diff shows genre-description and game-info response functions but the truncated diff does not show actual game HTML generation logic — the visible code only returns text descriptions about genres/games, not self-contained HTML/CSS/JS game payloads. The core requirement of generating actual playable game HTML from user prompts is not evidenced in the visible diff.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "When a user asks the AI to create, build, or make a video game, the backend generates a structured gamePayload containing a complete, self-contained HTML/CSS/JavaScript game renderable in a sandboxed iframe.",
      "reason": "The visible portion of backend/main.mo shows only text description responses for genres (e.g., 'RPGs are story-driven games...', 'Shooters focus on gun combat...') and keyword-matching for existing game titles. No code is visible that generates actual HTML/CSS/JS game payloads or detects game-creation intents ('make me a platformer', 'create a shooter', etc.) and returns a populated gamePayload field. The diff is truncated so this may exist, but based on available evidence the game HTML generation logic is not confirmed.",
