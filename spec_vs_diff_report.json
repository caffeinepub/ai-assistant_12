  "summary": "The diff implements most requirements but has two notable gaps: (1) the backend conversationHistory is not stored in stable storage (uses var instead of stable var), and (2) the response engine is not rule-based or pattern-matching — it simply echoes the user message. The frontend correctly implements chat UI, typing indicator, clear conversation, auto-scroll, and the futuristic dark theme with neon accents.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Conversation history is persisted in stable storage as an array of message records with role, content, and timestamp fields",
      "reason": "The backend declares 'var conversationHistory : [Message] = []' without the 'stable' keyword, meaning the conversation history will not survive canister upgrades and is not stored in stable storage.",
