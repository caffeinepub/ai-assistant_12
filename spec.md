# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a conversational AI chat application with a rule-based backend and a sleek futuristic dark-mode UI.

**Planned changes:**
- Backend actor stores conversation history (role, content, timestamp) in stable storage
- Backend exposes functions to send a message, receive a rule-based/pattern-matching response, retrieve history, and clear history
- Chat UI displays messages in a thread with user messages right-aligned and AI messages left-aligned
- Animated typing indicator shown while awaiting a response
- "Clear conversation" button resets chat history
- Message thread auto-scrolls to the latest message
- Futuristic dark-mode theme: near-black background, neon green/cyan accents, modern monospaced or sans-serif font, subtle glow effects on AI bubbles and active inputs
- AI avatar icon displayed alongside assistant messages

**User-visible outcome:** Users can type messages and receive contextual AI-style responses in a sleek sci-fi chat interface, with full conversation history persisted and the ability to clear the chat at any time.
