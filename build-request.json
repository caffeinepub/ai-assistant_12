      "id": "REQ-4",
      "text": "Fix the backend AI response logic so that when a user sends a message, the assistant returns a meaningful, contextually relevant response instead of echoing or copying the user's input back to them. The simulated AI should produce varied, helpful replies appropriate to a gaming assistant context (e.g., tips, suggestions, answers to gaming questions) rather than repeating what the user typed.",

      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "Sending any message to the AI never results in a response that simply repeats or mirrors the user's input verbatim.",
        "The AI returns a distinct, meaningful reply for common gaming-related inputs (e.g., asking for tips, game recommendations, or help with a specific game).",
        "The AI response varies based on the content of the user's message rather than always returning a generic or copied reply.",
        "Conversation history continues to be stored correctly with both user and assistant messages.",
        "The typing indicator still appears while the response is being generated."

    "Do not change the existing conversation history data model or backend storage schema.",
